## Prologue

Aging.

Maybe this is the culprit of all (says relatively healthy 30 something)
But there's something about my general well-being that can't be explained by aging.

It's not like I have a cancer_though for two weeks I thought I had_, or severe pain that debilitates my daily activities. It's rather masked by seemingly innocent bodily signal (no, not constipation). 

It's hunger. 

Severe hunger attack that debilitates my mental well-being. It's the sense that tells you that your life is in danger, makes you afraid and vulnerable. It's feeling that make you feel 'not prepared enough' to do whatever you are about to do. Oh, how much of this is mental? I bet it's 200%. When you are in the middle of doing something, you don't generally feel hunger this way.

No I don't have an eating disorder, I eat all the time, mostly vegetarian, drink keffir and love cheese on my pizza. 

I'm on the journey to eradicate this feeling, exhausted even before started, with vague insight where this is heading..
